# responsive-final

This is my response to our final exam challenge in class! 

This project gave me an opportunity to test my knowledge of things i've learned througout class and I also learned something new! 

<h1>I'm Most Proud Of</h1>

<h2>Dark Mode</h2>
<p>This feature was fun to create and helped me practice "if/else" statements. </p>

<h2>HSL Updates</h2>
<p>I really enjoyed the opportunity to take a moment to truly master hsl and the use of the :root element. </p>

<h3>Huge thanks to Kiki for all your help on my dev journey! It has truly been a pleasure! ðŸ˜Š </h3>
